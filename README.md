Project Description: Web Development - Login, Dashboard, and User Data Management.
(this project is just for the practice)

This web development project aims to create a dynamic and interactive user interface with various features such as login functionality, a dashboard, user data management, and integration with a Pokémon API.
The project starts with a login page where users can enter their credentials. Upon successful authentication, users are redirected to the home page, which features a sticky navbar and sidebar. The dashboard is the initial page displayed after login.
The sidebar allows users to navigate through different sections of the application. Clicking on specific components within the sidebar triggers the swapping of the main content area, dynamically updating it with relevant data.
One of the main functionalities of this project involves managing pokemons data. The "Users" page displays information about multiple pokemons. By clicking on a Pokémon's picture, a modal window pops up, presenting detailed information about that specific Pokémon. This data is retrieved from an external Pokémon API, providing accurate and up-to-date information.
